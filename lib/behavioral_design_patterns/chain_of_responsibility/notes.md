# Singleton
## Chain of Responsibility

![Chain of Responsibility](./imgs/chain_of_responsibility.png)

## Intent

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one
object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the
request along the chain until an object handles it.

## Applicability
